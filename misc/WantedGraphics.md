# Icons that I wish existed for free

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)  

In no particular order. These are desired as 256×256 or 512×512 icons with (usually) non-descript background, smaller variants down to 24×24 size would also be great.

These try to omit explanations for use cases since those should be numerous per icon.
