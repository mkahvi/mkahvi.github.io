# Icons that I wish existed

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)  

In no particular order. These are desired as 256×256 or 512×512 icons with (usually) non-descript background.

These try to omit explanations for use cases since those should be numerous per icon.

* Cowering person
* Cowering person with another threateningly over them
