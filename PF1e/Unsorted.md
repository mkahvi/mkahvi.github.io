## Minimum 4 skill points

Premise: No classes get less than 4 skill points per level.

This is just a pointless fuck you at some classes and casters don't become OP with it. Neither do the martials that suffer from lack of it.

Could even upgrade to 6 for all martials and semi-martials that don't have reason to get Int.

### Some references

| State | Classes | Skill points | Notes |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| :x: | Fighter & Paladin | 2 | Paladin has tertiary spellcasting. Fighter has nothing. |
| :white_check_mark: | Cavalier & Samurai | 4 | Both have animal companions. |
| :white_check_mark: | Bloodrager | 4  | Tertiary spellcasting like paladin. |
| :white_check_mark: | Barbarian | 4 | Somehow barbarian is more skilled than fighter? |
| :white_check_mark: | Ranger | **6** | Tertiary casting _and_ animal companion on top. |
| :white_check_mark: | Slayer | 6 | Nothing too special, just in really nice spot. |
| :x: | Magus & Warpriest | 2 | Secondary casters like hunter & investigator who get 6. |
| :white_check_mark: | Hunter, Investigator, Barb & Skald | **6** | Secondary casters all.<br/>Hunter even gets an animal companion. |
| :x: | Primary casters | 2 | Int-based primary casters are fine.<br/>It's the others that suffer for not much good reason. |

### Solution

Give all classes 4-6 minimum skill points.  
Possibly give Int-based classes 2 less.
