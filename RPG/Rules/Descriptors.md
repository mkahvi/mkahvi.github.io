# Descriptors (Traits)

Modifications and current form by: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

Bonus for adding one or more short descriptive words or terms about your character to serve as quick reminder what the character is like.

Example: stubborn, scaredy, lanky, jubilant, drunkard, smoker, sugarcane addict, chews lip, forgetful, confused, timid, boisterous, etc.

These are only as simple reminders for the player and do not mechanically affect gameplay, though for example as drunkard you might want to make a check to resist spending a few extra coins at the watering hole, as forgetful you might want to make recall memory check to see if your character remembers something that you as player still remember.

Since thereâ€™s no actual mechanical effect imposed by the guide, it is best these do not describe things that conflict with mechanics, but good roleplay can make that interesting regardless.
