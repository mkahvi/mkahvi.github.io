# Goals

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

Designate up to 3 goals for your character. These are things you are motivated to accomplish.

You gain a small bonus depending on how specific the goal is whenever you’re directly working towards the goal. You may suffer penalties on top of the bonuses if the goal is very general.

### Examples:

- I will cheat my way to wealth – a minor bonus to actions involving cheating for monetary gain.
- I want to kill monsters –  small bonus to offensive actions but penalty to defense due to how generic this is.

### Bad examples:

- I want to become powerful – too generic. Can be taken but should not give any benefit.

### Bad application examples:

- I will cheat my way to wealth – Stabbing someone to death to take their coin does not apply the bonuses.
- (same) – Stealing a coin from guard when running away from them for other reasons does not grant the bonus for the fleeing from the original cause.
