# Beliefs & Instincts

*Inspired by The Burning Wheel.*

Modifications and current form by: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

None of these impose any kind of checks by themselves, but can be used in some cases when player can’t or doesn’t want to decide if they want to act on a belief or instinct.

## Beliefs

Player should write down two to three beliefs for their characters, preferably covering as broad range as the following topics: what do they believe of themselves, what do they believe of the world at large, and what do they believe of their companions. These are in-character beliefs, not some hidden understanding of the character the player has.

Basic structure of good belief is: What is it, why is it so, and how are you going to change it? Best done in a form that the character would explain it to themselves.

**Really bad example**: I am the best.  
**Breakdown**: This leads to no action, you’re already the best and as the best you have no way of becoming bester.

**Bad example**: The world is a shit place.  
**Breakdown**: Tiny bit better because it actually describes something that can be acted on, but fails to explain why you think so. This also leaves no chance for your opinion to change since everything’s shit.

**Better example**: The world is a shit place because the nobles are strangling the common folk dry.  
**Breakdown**: This corrects the failing of the previous, but fails to explain what you’re going to do about it. Believing something is shit and blaming someone or something does not say you’re willing to do anything about it, thus counts as unactionable.

**Even better example**: The world is a shit place because the nobles are strangling the common folk dry, and I’m going to depose them, forcibly if I have to.  
**Breakdown**: This fixes the problems of the previous ones by explaining what you believe, why you believe it and how you’re going to act on it. 

Based on the above examples, first one leads to no action, you’re already the best and as the best you have no way of becoming bester. Second example is tiny bit better because it actually describes something that can be acted on, but fails to explain why it is a shit place. The third example corrects the failing of the second, but fails to explain what you’re going to do about it. Believing something is shit and blaming someone does not say you’re willing to do anything about it, thus counts as unactionable. Last example fixes the problems of the previous ones by actually saying what you’re going to do.

## Instincts

Player can have up to three instincts. These are behaviours the character participates in without much thought.

These can be seen also as ticks.

Basic structure is: what do you do and under what conditions and why.

**Not that great example**: Keep beard groomed whenever I am free to do so, because it is my pride and joy.  
**What does this mean**? Whenever you have a free hand, you’re likely stroking your beard, straightening it and feeling for flaws in its magnificence. This can bother some people, or make you seem like you’re scheming something evil.

**Better example**: I will always have my sword at my side. Having lost it once and paid dearly for it, I will not let go of it again.  
**What does this mean**? Did you bring your sword? You can point to this instinct and say yes, yes you did. Even if you panickedly run away with nothing on you, you somehow manage to grab your sword at least. This however causes problems when you’re asked to hand off your weapons, because your instinct tells you never to leave it. You may be forced to stay out or enter without it, grasping for the sword at your side that is there no longer. This can put off people or make you seem more vulnerable than you actually are, or any other number of things.
